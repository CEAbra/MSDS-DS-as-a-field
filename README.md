In this project, I used the NYPD Shooting Incident data of the period 2006-2023 from the NYC Open Data, a free public data repository published by New York City Agencies and other partners. I explored if the victims of shootings in New York during the years between 2006 and 2023 period were mostly female and, if there was a weekly and/or monthly pattern in the occurrence.
